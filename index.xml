      <description>CrossUO is an Open Source Ultima Online&amp;reg; client - a hard-fork from OrionUO, ported to Linux and MacOSX by fungos. The project is currently maintained by fungos, Deuce and Nirad.
The project aims to have a fully open cross-platform Ultima Online&amp;reg; client compatible with different eras from the game.
The CrossUO Suite is composed of the game client, the game launcher and updater and (for the foreseeable future) a closed source scriptable game assistant similar to Razor.</description>
